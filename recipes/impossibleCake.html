    <h2>Impossible Cake Recipe</h2>

    <p>
      This cake has a reputation! A sweet and tempting caramel is drizzled into
      a greased Bundt&#174; pan, followed by a gorgeous smooth mixture for a
      moist and rich chocolate cake and a layer of flan. Serve topped with more
      melted cajeta if you wish.

    <h3>Cake</h3>

      <li>&frac12 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 &frac12 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons strong brewed coffee</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the base and sides
        of a 10-inch fluted tube pan. Dust lightly with flour; tap to remove
        excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a shallow baking pan with enough water to come 1/3 of the way up
        the sides of the tube pan. Place water bath in the oven to warm up while
        it is preheating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour caramel sauce into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until warm and
        pourable, about 1 minute. Pour into the prepared tube pan, covering the
        base completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder together in a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat 1/2 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons butter in a bowl with an electric
        mixer until smooth. Add sugar; beat until light and fluffy. Beat in 1
        egg and coffee. Alternate adding flour mixture and milk, mixing well
        between additions. Pour cake batter evenly over caramel in the tube pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine evaporated milk, condensed milk, 4 eggs, and vanilla extract in
        the bowl of a food processor; blend until smooth. Pour over cake batter
        through a fine sieve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the water bath in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted
        into the chocolate cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cake cool, about 1 hour. Carefully run a thin knife around the edges
        to loosen the cake, cover with a serving plate, and flip onto the plate.
      </li>
    </ul>
